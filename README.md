# The Trolley Problem has been solved

## And the solution is VIOLENCE!

### Story

Robotics is advancing exponentially! A team of university students started working on an automated train last week, and by the time they got their first prototype working, the robot apocalypse had begun!

### Controls

- Use the **left** and **right arrows** to choose which direction to go at the next split in the path. If you don't make a choice in time, the train will derail!
- Use the **up arrow** to boost the train if you think you can handle the speed!

### Goal

Run over as many robots as possible to rack up the highest score you can! You'll get more points if you boost, but make sure not to derail or run into any blockades! The train's base speed will also increase over time. Can you keep up?
